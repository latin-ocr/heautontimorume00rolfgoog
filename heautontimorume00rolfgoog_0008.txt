PREFACE.

-----,--

Tuis little book has been prepared especially for the use of the
freshman classes in Hnnvnnn Uuwsusuv, but in the hope that it may
be found¹ useful in other institutions in which students are taught to
read at sight. Its general plan was suggested by Mn. hunnus “Aoui-
Pnou.”

The text is that os Dznnzuo, which has been followed without deviation.

ln some os the stage directions Ι have ventured, sor the sake os vivid-
ness, to indicate gestures which a modern actor would use under the
circumstances, although we have no evidence for believing that a Roman
actor would have expressed himself in the same way.

Ι am under great obligations to Pnou. Fnuwcis W. Ksisuw of the
Uuwussnw on M1cu1cnu, and Mn. Fului< W. Nicousow, Instructor in
Hnnvnnn Uuwuusiww, who have read the proofs, and given me many
valuable suggestions.

Jouu c, nonas.
